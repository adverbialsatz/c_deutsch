A header that defines german macros for all the C Keywords (and printf). I made this in a very short time, and I do not have any intention to continue working on this. 
This is either so useless and stupid that it hasn't been done before, or it has been done better already. I solemny swear that I did not copy anything to make this. After researching, I found out this has been done better before. Oh well, atleast I came up with the idea myself
